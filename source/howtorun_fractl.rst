Fast Reorder and CEDRIC Technique in LROSE (FRACTL)
===================================================

FRACTL is a fast traditional solver with integrated interpolation using
LROSE infrastructure, and it is able to perform both gridding and
multi-Doppler synthesis for airborne radars and multiple ground-based
radars, which is different than Radx2Grid whereas it only has the
capability for gridding of a single ground-based radar data. FRACTL
adopts both REORDER and CEDRIC programs which REORDER is a program that
transforms radar data from its native coordinate system to cartesian
space and the data can then be ingested into CEDRIC for synthesis.

Running FRACTL
--------------

The main features of using FRACTL are: - “Traditional” multi-Doppler
solver written from the ground up in C++ - Quasi-horizontal 2-radar
assumption (U,V) with mass-continuity for W, or full 3D solution (U, V,
W) - Nearest neighbor algorithm adds Doppler gates directly to matrix
solver at each grid point, no interpolation or averaging of velocity
required - Solve normal equations using Singular Value Decomposition
(preferred) or Cramer’s method - Subset of CEDRIC diagnostics
implemented, more on the way - Fast computation. It takes less than 5
minutes for dual-Doppler synthesis (~3M gates) - Doppler data only

To check all command line options for FRACTL, including debugging
options and file paths, the typical ‘-h’ flag can be invoked:

.. code:: terminal

   lrose -- fractl -h

Likewise, to obtain the default parameter file, use the following
command:

.. code:: terminal

   lrose -- fractl -print_params > fractl.params

There are several key parameters to look for and modify and they are
listed below. After modifying the parameter file to your desired output
analysis, type the following command to the terminal to invoke the
program:

.. code:: terminal

   lrose -- fractl -params fractl.params

-  Note: FRACTL accepts the file format either with CfRadial or DORADE
   currently. Different than Radx2Grid, FRACTL doesn’t require the
   CfRadial file with an aggregation of the sweeps.

The FRACTL parameter file
-------------------------

To control FRACTL’s operation, there are several key parameters to be
modified in order to obtain the desired output.

-  minDbz: any values below the minimum reflectivity will be tossed out.
-  minNcp: any values below the minimum NCP will be tossed out. Note
   that both NEXRAD WSR88D and NOAA P-3 tail radars do not have this
   variable currently, so the NCP variable can be replaced by any other
   variables to perform the simple quality control (QC). Both minDbz and
   minNcp are designed for the QC of a real-time analysis.
-  testMode: the default test mode is MODE_ZETA. The testMode option is
   designed for the developers to test and debug.
-  zGrid: specify vertical grid spacing “incr” or “min, max, incr” which
   represents the lowest level, the highest level, and constant spacing
   of the vertical level respectively.
-  yGrid: similar as zGrid. It specifies the grid parameters in y.
-  xGrid: similar as zGrid. It specifies the grid parameters in x.
-  gridType: mesh is for stand-alone analysis, while mish is as a
   background field for SAMURAI input. For the current release, we
   recommend the users to use mesh for the analysis. The mish gridType
   is experimental and still under development.
-  projLat0: the latitude of the reference point (0,0).
-  projLon0: the longitude of the reference point (0,0).
-  numNbrMax: the maximum points for the nearest neighbor algorithm to
   consider at each grid point.
-  inDir: input directory for searching for files. Files will be
   searched for in this directory.
-  fileRegex: regular expression to select files in inDir. If input file
   format is CfRadial (DORADE), specify it as “^cfrad (^swp)”.
-  outTxt: specify the directory of a output summary file which contains
   verification of grid results.
-  outNc: specify the directory of a output netCDF file which is the
   result of the analysis.
-  radialName: specify the variable name of radial velocity.
-  dbzName: specify the variable name of reflectivity.
-  ncpName: specify the variable name of NCP. If there is no NCP
   variable, you can specify any other variable to perform the QC. This
   variable corresponds to minNcp for the threshold.
-  uvInterp: set the wind interpolation method for u and v. The
   specified interpolation method will be applied before calculating the
   vertical velocity. The default mode is INTERP_NONE.
